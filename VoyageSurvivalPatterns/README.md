Project Overview :::
    This project explores passenger data from a historic maritime voyage to uncover patterns in survival outcomes. Using data-driven techniques, it analyzes       demographic and socio-economic factors that influenced passenger fate.

Techniques Used :::
   1) Data Preparation: Cleaned and transformed passenger data using Power Query.
   2) Modeling: Built relationships and calculated columns to support analysis.
   3) Visualizations: Created interactive dashboards with slicers, charts, and filters.
   4) DAX Measures: Used DAX to calculate survival rates and group-based insights.
   

Key Insights :::
    1) Gender and class played significant roles in survival likelihood
    2) Certain age groups had higher survival rates
    3) Cabin location and ticket fare correlated with outcomes
