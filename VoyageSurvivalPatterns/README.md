Project Overview 
    This project explores passenger data from a historic maritime voyage to uncover patterns in survival outcomes. Using data-driven techniques, it analyzes       demographic and socio-economic factors that influenced passenger fate.

Techniques Used
    Data Preparation: Cleaned and transformed passenger data using Power Query.
    Modeling: Built relationships and calculated columns to support analysis.
    Visualizations: Created interactive dashboards with slicers, charts, and filters.
    DAX Measures: Used DAX to calculate survival rates and group-based insights.
    User Experience: Enhanced navigation with tooltips and bookmarks.

Key Insights
    Gender and class played significant roles in survival likelihood
    Certain age groups had higher survival rates
    Cabin location and ticket fare correlated with outcomes
